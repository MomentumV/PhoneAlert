# PhoneAlert README #

 ## Setup instructions ##
   - You will need to creat both a twitter app and a Twilio free user trial
   - The api keys and search terms go into config.yml.sample, save it as config.yml.

 ## helpful hints ##
   - get_ids.py is a little script that returns the twitter user id from an entered twitter @handle
   - sms notification is used when your streaming app is rate limited. don't do too much testing with a live stream; save some data and work with that.
